# cifar10_classifier_pytorch   

This repo is a basic implementation of trainning a classifer in Pytorch  
Most of the repo contents are from pytorch official documentation https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html  
I have made this repo in order to get hands on with pytorch.

I have used a simple 2 layer conv net to train on a CIFAR-10 dataset. .
